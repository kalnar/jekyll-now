# kalnarblogs

**kalnarblogs** is the personal blogs of Robert Kalna. The site is built with Jekyll. The base of the project setup was forked 
from [here](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now), many thanks to **barryclark**. 

## LICENCES

The project is under MIT licence. 

I am including the license file form the forked project, see *LICENSE-jekyll*. 

The style of the blog is based on [agency bootstrap theme](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-agency) which is licensed under MIT, thus an other license is included *LICENSE-agency-bootstrap*.
