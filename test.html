    <h2>Strong</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Represents strong importance for its contents. Indicate relative importance by nesting strong elements; each strong element increases the importance of its contents. Changing the importance of a piece of text with the strong element does not change the meaning of the sentence.</p>

    <h2>Section</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Represents a generic document or application section. In this context, a section is a thematic grouping of content, typically with a header, possibly with a footer.
