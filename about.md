<p class="ambitions">
Well, first of all I want to be a good father. The rest is flexible, but I really am enjoying software development, so professionally I will stay on this course. I hope to work on software which can be used in education. I am from Budapest, Hungary, and I always felt that schools and teacher should rely more on technology there, not sure how it is elsewhere. I wish to contribute to this domain, but I still need to study a little before I start taking this seriously. However, what I love is solving problems, so even if it's not education related I am really happy to work on something interesting. 
</p>

<p class="ambitions">
Furthermore, I love learning languages, I still want to learn a few; Japanese, Spanish, a sign language for sure, and there are other that I am considering like Dutch, Chinese, maybe Arabic. Of course I need somehow not to forget how to use the languages that I already speak...so it's quite a challenge, but I love it.
</p>

<p class="ambitions">
So I am passionate about learning, getting to know a system which was unknown to me before. I would like to study someday philosophy and linguistics as well.
</p>

<p class="ambitions">
Finally, I really want to live in Japan for a year or so. I have already been there once, but I want the full experience, I want to explore japan, and talk to people there.
